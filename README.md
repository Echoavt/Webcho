# Webcho Game

## Development

Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

The compiled build is located in the `docs` directory. This folder can be used
directly with GitHub Pages, so you can preview the game in your browser without
installing anything by opening `docs/index.html` or deploying it as a Pages
site.
